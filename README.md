# Improved Error Handling in Dart HTTP Requests

This example demonstrates a common issue in Dart: generic exception handling in asynchronous HTTP requests using the `http` package.  The original code catches all exceptions without differentiating the error types. This makes debugging network errors, API errors (like 404 Not Found), or other issues difficult.

The solution refactors the error handling to catch specific exception types, providing more detailed error messages and handling different error scenarios more effectively. This allows for better error reporting and more robust applications.
